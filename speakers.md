					<h3>CJ Schwartz</h3>
                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cj_Schwartz2" class="icon fa-home"></a>
				</header>
				<p>CJ Schwartz received his BS degree in Genetics from the University of Minnesota, a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin, and a postdoc at the Salk Institute in San Diego with Joanne Chory and Detlef Weigel focusing on natural variation of light responsiveness. After nearly 20 years in academia, CJ founded a company 5 years ago (Sunrise Genetics), which applies modern molecular genetic techniques for gene discovery and MAS breeding in Cannabis. In collaboration with the University of Minnesota and the JCVI, Sunrise Genetics was the first to make public a high-quality Cannabis genome assembly, which is recognized as the Cannabis genomic reference accession by NCBI.

			Julie Dawson is an Associate Professor in the Department of Horticulture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Her background is in organic plant breeding and participatory research. Research topics include season extension methods, organic and participatory variety trials and variety selection for small-acreage farms and gardens as well as extension resources for urban growers. She leads a project called the Seed to Kitchen Collaborative with other plant breeders to test varieties with local farmers and chefs, focused on flavor for local food systems.

                    <a href="https://baileylab.ucdavis.edu/" class="icon fa-home"></a>
				</header>
				<p> Brian Bailey started as an assistant professor in the UC Davis Plant Sciences Department in 2016. His research combines engineering, computer science, atmospheric science, and biology to study plant systems. In particular, Brian's lab is developing high-resolution, 3D models and measurement techniques that can explicitly represent plant-environment interactions at scales ranging from leaves to canopies. Recent work in the Bailey lab has focused on developing models for woody perennial crops such as almond and grapevine. Brian received his MS and PhD degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Utah.

                <p>Troy is an Assistant Professor this year in the Department of Plant Sciences. He was most recently a research scientist in the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA.  His research tries to ‘see’ the things that feed our families, clean our air, and nourish our ecosystems a little differently. His lab group distills images of fields and forests into a kaleidoscope of colors to inform our understanding of plant health, productivity, and stress.
